# Hilt Sample Application

This sample app showcases Google's new DI library, Dagger Hilt.  Dagger Hilt was designed to solve some of the pain points of using Dagger2 in android applications.
The benefits of using Dagger Hilt instead of Dagger 2 are;

* Reduced boilerplate
* Decoupled build dependencies
* Simplified configuration
* Improved testing
* Standardized components
